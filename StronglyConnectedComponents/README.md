# Strongly Connected Components
Author: Massimo Giusti

## Summary:
- Kosajaru.js returns the strongly connected components of a graph by implementing Kosajaru's two-pass algorithm.
- A Strongly Connected Component is defined as a node in a graph that is reachable by every other node in the graph

## Algorithm:
- The algorithm to find the strongly connected components of a graph relies heavily on DFS. First, DFS is ran on every node
